Question Answering with Transformers: Task List
Phase 1: Project Setup & Requirements [x]
 Research Project Requirements
 Analyze 
Task_description.txt
 and documentation
 Extract core requirements (BERT/DistilBERT, SQuAD v1.1)
 Development Environment Setup
 Create 
requirements.txt
 with core dependencies
 Initialize project folder structure (data/, models/, src/)
 Create initial Implementation Plan
Phase 2: Data Acquisition & EDA [ ]
 Dataset Preparation
 Load SQuAD v1.1 via Hugging Face datasets
 Create data loading scripts in src/data_loader.py
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Analyze context and question length distributions
 Visualize sample contexts, questions, and answers
 Check for data imbalances or missing spans
Phase 3: Preprocessing & Tokenization [ ]
 Tokenization Strategy
 Initialize AutoTokenizer (DistilBERT/BERT)
 Implement sliding window (doc-stride) for long contexts
 Span Mapping
 Map character-based answer start/end to token-based indices
 Handle unanswerable questions (if using SQuAD v2.0 later)
 Validate preprocessed samples
Phase 4: Model Implementation & Fine-Tuning [ ]
 Model Selection & Setup
 Load AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
 Configure training arguments (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
 Training Pipeline
 Implement fine-tuning loop using Trainer API or PyTorch
 Save model checkpoints to models/
 Monitor training and validation loss
Phase 5: Evaluation & Error Analysis [x]
 Metrics Calculation
 Calculate Exact Match (EM) score
 Calculate F1 score
 Model Comparison
 Compare DistilBERT vs BERT (optional bonus)
 Performance Analysis
 Identify common failure modes (short vs long answers)
 Document final model performance
Phase 6: Deployment (Streamlit App) [x]
 Application Development
 Create app/app.py for Streamlit interface
 Integrate the fine-tuned model for inference
 User Interface Design
 Implement text area for context and input for question
 Add highlighting for the extracted answer span
Phase 7: Web Miniapp (React + FastAPI) [ ]
 FastAPI Backend Development
 Set up FastAPI project structure in web/backend/
 Create API endpoints for model inference
 Implement CORS and basic error handling
 React Frontend Development
 Initialize React app (Vite) in web/frontend/
 Design interactive QA components (Context, Question, Answer)
 Connect frontend to FastAPI endpoints
 Add animations and premium styling (modern UI)
Phase 8: Final Documentation [ ]
 Final Report
 Summarize project findings and model architecture
 Create usage instructions in 
README.md
 Code Cleanup
 Refactor and comment all source code
 Generate final walkthrough/demo recording
